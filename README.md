# clixlogix-samplecode Dashboard

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have Node 12.0.0 or up. We recommend upgrading to the LTS version of NodeJS available at [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). You can also use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

## Quick Start
Run following commands:


Clone the repo on your machine. Ensure you are added to the repo.

### `npm install`

Install dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
